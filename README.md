# adventofcode2022

My code for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Each file will start with the number of its day (so `1.py` is the code for day one, and `1-data.txt` is the data for day one). I've also included a PDF that will be updated with the prompts, the code, and eventually explanations.
